Teisai formats a string from teisai dialect to HTML.
It doesn't use any complicated parsing, so it's not a real language, it only
uses regexes and basic substitutions. That said, you can nest quotes inside
quotes, because it was trivial to implement.
If you can implement a proper parser for teisai that would allow nested lists
and other more complicated stuff - feel free to contribute.

# Implemented formats

* paragraphs (empty line)
* headers ('# ' to '###### ')
* blockquotes ('> ')
* line breaks (' +' at the end of the line)
* horizontal rule ('===')
* bold (**word**)
* underline (__word__)
* italic (~~word~~)
* strike (--word--)
* footnotes ('[^1]' and '[^1]:')
* unordered lists ('* ')
* ordered lists ('- ')
* images (':()' for normal, ':(^)' for clickable, ':[]()' for hidden)
* links ('@()' for normal, '@(^)' for outside, '@[]()' for title)
* tables ('|' as a separator, and '|!' to declare <thead>)
* metadata ('?')

A: Put \ in the beginning of the paragraph before the HTML tag begins, like so `\<div></div>`.
